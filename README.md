# Django-Practice-Site
This django site is used for my practice.


To run the repo:

>>First clone the repo

Then in terminal type:

>>python -m venv .venv

Here env is the name of the virtual environment. Do not create virtual environment with random name. Otherwise, there will be issues for others to run the repo.
Then

>>.venv\Scripts\activate

This will activate the virtual environment. Now install django using

>>pip install django

To install Pillow

>>pip install Pillow

Now run the repo using

>>python manage.py runserver
